# RFC Process for Paradigm Framework

This directory contains Request for Comments (RFC) documents for the Paradigm Framework. RFCs are used to propose significant changes, new features, or architectural decisions that require team discussion before implementation.

## What is an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a document that proposes a significant change to the Paradigm Framework. RFCs provide a consistent and controlled way to:

- Propose substantial changes to the framework
- Document the rationale and approach for technical decisions
- Allow for team-wide review, feedback, and consensus
- Create an audit trail for significant architectural decisions
- Ensure thorough consideration before implementing major changes

## When to Write an RFC

You should create an RFC when you want to:

- Add or modify a significant feature or capability
- Change the public API or behavior of existing components
- Modify the framework's architecture
- Propose a significant refactoring effort
- Introduce new dependencies or technologies
- Change processes that affect multiple teams

Minor changes, bug fixes, and small improvements can be addressed through the normal pull request process without requiring an RFC.

## RFC Process

1. **Draft Stage**: Create a new RFC document using the [template](./template.md) and place it in this directory with a name format of `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`.

2. **Team Discussion**: Share the RFC document with the team via a pull request. The PR should be open for at least one week to give team members time to review and comment.

3. **Revision**: Update the RFC based on feedback received during the discussion period.

4. **Approval**: The RFC is considered approved when there is consensus among core team members and relevant stakeholders. This should be documented in the PR comments.

5. **Implementation**: Once approved, the RFC can be implemented. Reference the RFC document in any related implementation PRs.

6. **Completion**: After implementation, update the RFC's status to "Implemented" or "Complete."

## RFC States

RFCs can be in one of the following states:

- **Draft**: Initial proposal, under discussion
- **Approved**: Accepted for implementation
- **Rejected**: Proposal rejected
- **Implemented**: Changes have been completed
- **Superseded**: RFC has been replaced by another RFC (reference the new RFC)

## RFC Directory Structure

All RFCs should be stored in this directory with the naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`

For example:
```
docs/rfc/
├── README.md (this file)
├── template.md 
├── 2023-07-15-authentication-service-redesign.md
└── 2023-08-02-data-provider-interface-update.md
```
